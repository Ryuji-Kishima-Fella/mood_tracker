A simple Python program that helps you log and track your daily moods - made as my first GitHub project.

This console-based app lets you:
- Record how how you feel each day
- View your mood history
- NEW!: See a summary of how often each mood occurs
- Identify your most frequent mood 
- Saves data locally in 'mood_log.txt'

## Future Improvements
- Add charts/graphs
- Add daily reminders
- Turn into a web or mobile app
